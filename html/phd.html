      <h1>Stellar Populations of NGC 6822 with JWST</h1>

	  <p> I completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh in 2025. With my supervisor <a href=https://www.roe.ac.uk/~ojones/>Olivia Jones</a>, we worked on the first resolved stellar populations observed by <em>JWST</em>, with specific focus on the evolved dust producing stars. I developed <a href=https://github.com/conornally/starbug2>starbug2</a>, a PSF photometry set of tools for detecting faint and deeply dust embedded point sources in complex and crowded environments.

	  <h2> Lay summary </h2>

	  <p> When a star like our Sun gets to the end of its life, it will expand so large as to engulf the Earth. This red <i>giant</i> becomes a thousand times brighter and very unstable. We call it an "<i>Asymptotic Giant Branch</i>" (AGB) star. These dying stars are important because they produce a lot of dust, and as the saying goes, "<i>everything is made of star dust</i>". AGB stars, therefore, play a crucial role in the production of natal materials from which all planets and stars are formed.  </p>

	  <p> With the new space telescope, <em>JWST</em>, we can observe these AGB stars in more detail than ever before. By studying them in a diverse range of galaxies, we can begin to build a picture of the origin and continued recycling of dust in the Universe. One such galaxy is NGC 6822. Although it is one of our closest galactic neighbours (~1.5 million light years away), it has a similar composition to galaxies in the more distant Universe.  </p>

	  <p> In my thesis, I develop the <a href=https://github.com/conornally/starbug2>tools</a> to detect nearly <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.531..183N/abstract>a million stars</a> in infrared <em>JWST</em> images of the central region of NGC 6822. I identify a wide range of "species", locating a small subset that are the AGB stars. By matching the shapes of their spectra to a library of theoretical models, I measure properties such as temperature, luminosity, chemical composition and the rate at which they produce dust. I demonstrate that the majority of the dust originates from a small number of particularly extreme individuals, and estimate the total quantity produced throughout the entire galaxy. By isolating the primary chemistry of the stars, I find that NGC 6822 exhibits a far higher proportion of oxygen-rich dust than expected. Finally, I develop a system of measuring AGB dust production rate from a set of observable properties, allowing for this research to be conducted at a greater scale in the future.  </p>
