			<p>Back when tigers used to smoke, the Great Halls of Diabaig were home to a thriving civilisation. However, few records survived the ensuing fires when a dragon moved in. Descend to the depths of Diabaig, carefully navigate the twisting corridors and dangerous creatures and return with a tooth from the dragon's jaws.</p>

			<p>Diabaig is a traditional turn-based ASCII roguelike where you are never more than a few mistakes away from death. Choose a starting class, find powerful items, and learn new spells and techniques to face increasingly dangerous adversity. You will discover many floors with rooms filled with unique creatures, magic scrolls, unknown potions and mighty weapons. Use everything at your disposal to survive as long as possible and defeat the dragon, but remember to keep enough spare for the return journey.</p>

			<p> The release of this is a big moment for me. I began development on diabaig as a "quick" lockdown project. As many roguelike developers experience, I have countless abandoned prototypes and engines, the primary goal for diabaig was simply to finish and release something. As a result, the underlying framework for diabaig is simple and protection against scope creep built in from the start. However, development halted after 80% due to an undetectable seg fault bug. Periodically, during the following years, I would pick the source code back up and work on it, before again struggling to locate this issue. Finally, five years later, I got to version 1.0 and released it to the world.</p>
