			<p> The impetus to design my first origami model came during a climbing trip in the south of Spain. The cliffs were home to massive griffon vultures, which would glide past within near touching distance. Watching them all week, I was inspired to make one (and I guess I was doing a lot of origami at the time). However, I was never able to find a vulture design in a flying pose.. so I made my own.</p>
			<p> Now, admittedly it looks very little like the reference, and more like a generic flying bird, but that is to be expected, I designed it in a tent with scrap paper from the bins.</p>
			<p> Difficulty: Easy</p>
			<p>Paper recommendation: 15cm single colour </p>
