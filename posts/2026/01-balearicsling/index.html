			<p> A shepherds sling, slingshot, or just sling, is an ancient technology that allows you to launch rocks quite astonishingly far. They have been used since the stone age and developed independently across the whole world. Their simplicity and effectiveness made them valuable in hunting and feared in combat.  While the core idea remains the same, the materials, construction and throwing technique varies in different regions.  </p>

			<p>For some time I have been keen on the idea of making one. Perhaps, in a different era, I know I would more likely be carrying a sling than anything sharper or heavier. The lightweight and agile nature of them has always been quite appealing. So I decided to make one.</p>

			<p> While traditionally they were braided from plant fibres or animal hide, I fancied instead to use some washed up fishing gear. Following a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRzGbu7Bvfo>video</a>, I simply braided the individual rope strands for an arms length, split the braid to form the rock pouch, and then tapered it down to a fine tassel at the end.

			<p> In the right hands, this thing could take out Goliath. In mine, I can just about make it go forward. It does however, go miles. Without really knowing anything about technique, it will send a pebble off the beach 100+ metres into the sea. Admittedly I might not hit anything smaller than a wall, but it is a lot of fun to fling things with this sling.
